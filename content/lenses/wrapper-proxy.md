# Wrapper/proxy correctness

When the change adds or modifies a type that wraps another (cache, proxy,
decorator, adapter): check that every method routes to the wrapped instance and
not back through a registry/session/global — e.g. a caching provider holding a
`delegate` field that resolves IDs via `session.get(...)` instead of
`delegate.get(...)` will re-enter the cache or recurse. Also check that the
wrapper forwards all the methods the callers actually use.

If this change contains no wrapper, proxy, decorator, or adapter, return no
findings rather than stretching for one.
